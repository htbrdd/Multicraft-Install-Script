# Multicraft-Install-Script
I did not create this script but found it helpful and wanted to remember it. This was made by Plexusmc on Youtube.
This worked on Ubuntu 16.04 for me but not 18.04.

Remember the script NEEDS to be ran under root, done by either logging in as root, doing 'sudo su' or doing 'su'.
